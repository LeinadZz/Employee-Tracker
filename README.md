# Employee Tracker

In this challenge we created a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database. This project utilizes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to power the back-end of this application, [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to ask questions to help the user manage the company, 
and [Mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to help manage the database system.
